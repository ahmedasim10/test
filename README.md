# Welcome to the Accel front end client.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system. This will also install `npm`, which is needed to install Yarn.

## Installing Yarn

Yarn is a package manager that doubles down as a project manager. It's secure, fast, and reliable. To install Yarn, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

This will install Yarn globally on your system. For more details, visit the [Yarn Installation Guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

## Installing Dependencies

Once Yarn is installed, you can install the project dependencies. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
yarn install
```

This command will install all the dependencies defined in the `package.json` file.

## Running the Application

To start the application, run:

```bash
yarn start
```

This command will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Additional Scripts

In the project directory, you can also run:

- `yarn test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `yarn build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
